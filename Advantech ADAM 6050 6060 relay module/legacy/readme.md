# This recipe is deprecated #
This recipe makes use of the full MODBUS Python library of which only coil reading & writing over TCP functionality
is required. There is also an outstanding issue where the use of the recipe causes 100% CPU core usage.

It is recommended the simpler, lightweight and more versatile recipe called **ADAM 6060 relay controller** is used instead.
